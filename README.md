# [Multi-Step Validation](https://walid-multistep.netlify.app/) - React Web Application

Multi-Step Validation is a robust React web application designed to streamline the process of collecting and validating user data across multiple steps. With its intuitive interface and comprehensive form components, this application makes it easy to gather accurate information from your users in a structured manner.

## Features

- Begin Card: The Begin Card serves as the starting point for your multi-step validation process. It provides an introduction and invites users to begin providing the required information.

- Quelle est ton regime alimentaire (What is your dietary regimen): This step includes a checkbox form component called DietForm, allowing users to indicate their dietary preferences. Users can select from a range of options to specify their dietary restrictions, preferences, or special requirements.

- Food Style (Cuisine Preferences): This step collects information about the user's preferred cuisine styles. Users can indicate their favorite food styles, such as Italian, Mexican, Asian, and more. This data enables you to personalize their experience based on their culinary preferences.

- Allergies: In this step, users can disclose any known allergies they have. This information is vital for ensuring their safety and allowing you to tailor your offerings or recommendations accordingly.

- Hatelove (Food Preferences): Users are given the opportunity to share their loved and hated food items in this step. This valuable insight allows you to understand their preferences better and create a more personalized experience.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
